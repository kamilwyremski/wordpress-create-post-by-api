# WordPress Create Post By API in PHP

## Overview
This PHP project demonstrates how to interact with the WordPress API to dynamically create and publish posts. By utilizing the WordPress REST API, users can submit content, media, and tags through a simple HTML form, which is then processed by a PHP backend.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the project to your local environment.
2. Set up your WordPress credentials in the `.env` file, including the domain, username, and password.
3. Open `index.php` in your web browser or deploy it to a web server.
4. Fill out the form with the necessary post details, such as title, LID, content, tags, and an optional link to an external image.
5. Click the "Send" button to submit the form, and the PHP backend will handle the WordPress API requests.
